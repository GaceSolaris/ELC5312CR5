# Class Report 5 for ELC 5312

## Folder Structure
The above folder structure is the identical structure used for the entire process of the assignment. All folders are needed for ensuring full testing of the process from bitstream generation to programming the board.

### For only testing the assignment
To program the board through Vitis, I have condensed the critical files to a single folder: projectfiles. Only download this folder and use the folder as the workspace within Vitis. The bitstream, mmi file, and elf files should be the only files needed to run the program on another board.
